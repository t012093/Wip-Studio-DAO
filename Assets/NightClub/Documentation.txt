There are two scripts in this package.
One for the multi color light, and one for the rotating disco light.


COLOR CHANGING LIGHT

This script is attached to the prefab Nightclub>Lights>Multicolor_LightCube.
The name of the script is "MultiColorLight.cs".
A lights source has to be attached to the script. You can do this in the editor. In the prefab, it is the lightsource in the
prefab that is attached.
The script iterates through all color hue values, with steps of 0.001. This makes the attached light slowly change color.


ROTATING DISCO LIGHT

This script is attached to the prefab Nightclub>Lights>RotatingDiscoLights.
The name of the script is "RotatingDiscopLight.cs"
This script rotates the gameobject it is attached to. In the inspector you have to attah four lightsources.
The prefab contains these lightsources. Also, in the inspector you can switch one or more lights on or off.
The code to do this is pretty straight forward.

If you have any questions about the code, please contact info@devjockeys.com
